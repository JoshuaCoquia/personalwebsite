			<h3 id="Who%20am%20I%3F">Who am I?</h3>
			<p>My name is <b>Joshua Coquia</b>. I am a freshman in high school, and I aspire to be some form of software developer when I grow up. I am currently considering getting a degree in computer science. I am self-taught, and I learned everything I know about programming through YouTube videos and websites on the internet. All of my current projects are websites, where I use the concepts I learned online to create a good looking website for the end user. For all of my current projects, I use TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that has a type system, a compiler to catch errors, and tooling to make development easier. I am familiar with using Vite, React, SCSS, and a few other technologies that make web development easier. I additionally have some amount of experience in C++ and Python.</p>
			<p>I am also a gamer; I am not just a person trying to complete high school. I play many video games on my computer and on my phone. My favorite video game currently is <a href="https://tetr.io">TETR.IO</a>, a fast-paced competitive block stacking game. In the game, my username is <a href="https://ch.tetr.io/u/sjosh137" title="View my profile!">sjosh137</a>, and I am a X rank player (or a player in the 99th percentile) with almost 500 hours in the game. I like the game for its fast pace, the high amount of competition, and the seemingly infinitely high skill ceiling it has. In general, I play video games to be competitive and to have fun.</p>

			<h3 id="What%20is%20this%3F">What is this?</h3>
			<p>This is a website where I write about my life and show my creations. In this website, I write about my personal life, my experience in education, my experience in programming, and many other subjects. I showcase my online projects, and I might additionally showcase a few of my other projects.</p>
			<p>I will write about my personal life, which includes the games I play, the devices I use, the way I live, and more. I will be writing about my education, how I feel about it, how I have been doing in school, and what I plan on doing in my future in terms of education. I will be writing about the years that I have done programming as a hobby, and how I plan on getting a job in some form of software development.</p>
			<p>I will write about my projects. This website is just one project I want to create. I will create many different things, and I will post about the creation of them here. I plan to post the project itself, my experience with making it, and the finished product.</p>
